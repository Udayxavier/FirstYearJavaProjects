# FirstYearJavaProjects

This repository contains various Java projects developed as part of my first-year Computer Science coursework at Western University. These projects cover fundamental programming concepts such as object-oriented programming (OOP), data structures, file handling, and algorithmic problem-solving.

First Assignment Project: LetterCrush is a simple grid-based matching game implemented in Java. The game operates on a 2D character grid, where the goal is to remove the longest contiguous line of matching characters. When a line is removed, gravity is applied to shift remaining characters downward, and this process continues until the grid stabilizes.The game features dynamic grid initialization, automatic line detection and removal, cascading effects, and gravity mechanics to ensure smooth gameplay.This project showcases array manipulation, object-oriented programming, and algorithmic problem-solving in Java.

Second Assignment Project: LinkedNumber Project. I Developed a doubly linked list-based numerical system in Java, demonstrating skills in data structures, OOP, and algorithm design. Implemented base conversions (2â€“16), number validation, and arithmetic operations, optimizing memory usage and performance. Applied exception handling, modular design, and efficient linked list operations to ensure scalability and robustness. Strengthened problem-solving and software development skills.

Third Assignment Project: FrogPath is a Java program that finds the best path for a frog to navigate a hexagonal pond, avoiding obstacles and collecting food. It reads a pond map from a file and uses priority-based movement and backtracking to determine the optimal route. The algorithm considers factors like avoiding mud, staying away from alligators, and preferring food and safe tiles. The program tracks flies collected and ensures the frog reaches the destination efficiently.

Fourth Assignment Project: QuadrantTree is a Java implementation of a quadtree for efficient image representation and processing. It recursively divides a 2D image into quadrants, storing pixel colors and reducing redundancy by averaging colors at higher levels. The tree structure allows fast pixel retrieval, color matching, and spatial searching based on coordinates. This project demonstrates recursive data structures, efficient image decomposition, and hierarchical spatial partitioning in Java.
